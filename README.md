# CS305 Final Thoughts

Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that offers personalized financial plans, including savings, investments, and insurance. They approached Global Rain to improve the security of their web application by adding a file verification step for secure data transfer, specifically through checksum verification and secure communications using HTTPS.

I effectively identified and addressed the client’s software vulnerabilities by applying secure coding practices, which are essential for protecting sensitive information and maintaining customer trust. Software security not only prevents breaches but also adds value to a company's reputation and operational stability. The challenge was ensuring that the security enhancements, such as encryption, didn’t introduce new issues, but tools like OWASP’s dependency-check and functional testing helped confirm the system’s integrity.

To ensure functionality and security, I refactored the code, implemented SHA-256 checksums, and enforced HTTPS for secure communications. Running static testing confirmed that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. For future projects, I would continue using OWASP tools and static analysis, and I would present this project to potential employers to demonstrate my skills in secure software development and vulnerability mitigation.
